function [C_rec] = Perm_Sim(D_ratio, time, membrane, cells, genplot)
%Simulates LiCl/MgCl mixed salt permeability experiment for specified
%normalized diffusivities of each ion, outputting the downstream
%concentration evolution over time
%   Function input is a dimensionless membrane diffusivity for each of
%       Li+, Mg2+, and Cl-, in that order. Values are dimensionalized using
%       the function DiffusivityDimensions.m.
%   Additionally, provide the time duration in minutes for the duration of
%       the simulation. 
%   Finally, provide structs containing membrane and cell
%       configurations, including concentrations, thicknesses, areas, and
%       volumes. These structs are acquired from Permeability_Import.m
%
%   Function output is the concentrations of Li+, Mg2+, and Cl- (mM) as a
%       function of time (min) in the downstream receiver chamber. Output
%       is formatted as a table. 
%
%   To handle startup, because outputs are not very reliable for the first
%       few simulated timepoints, they are excluded from the output. 
%
%   Donnan equiulibrium is handled via a separate function specifically
%       tuned to handle Li+, Mg2+, Cl- equilibrium, assuming the Ideal
%       Donnan model holds at the downstream side of the membrane:
%       Donnan_LiMgCl.m
%
%   The input genplot toggles the production of graphical results. It
%       should be a 2 point matrix of 0 (off) or 1 (on).
%   Genplot Key
%       The first bool value is the plot of concentrations over time
%       The second bool value is the plot of fluxes and SF over time
